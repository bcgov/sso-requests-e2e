# Documentation for Developers: Handling Common and Uncommon Issues

## Introduction

This documentation aims to guide developers through resolving some of the most common and not-so-common issues encountered during development and testing. These issues range from old test data and integration problems to delays in applications and memory issues. For a more comprehensive understanding, examples, detailed explanations, and additional configurations may need to be included in the sections outlined below.

## Common Issues

### 1. Old Test Data

- **Issue Description**: Stale or irrelevant test data that remains in the system can lead to inaccurate test results and hinder development progress.
- **Solution**: Regularly clean up old test data to ensure that tests are running on up-to-date and relevant data.
- **Old Data Recognition**: Integrations where the project name ends with **@20240328** (or similar dates) are integrations that were created during an earlier test run and should be cleaned out before running new tests. Teams where the name of the team is suffixed by an UUID (like: 0354f293-49ee-4563-b3c6-56eadefc06e6) are also created during an earlier test run and should be cleaned out before running new tests.

### 2. Integration Issues

- **Issue Description**: Integrations may remain in a "submitted" status indefinitely, causing endless loops and potential memory failures.
- **Solution**: Utilize Admin privileges to address and fix/remove integrations that are stuck in the submitted status.

### 3. Delays in App

- **Delays Issue**: Various factors can cause delays within the application, impacting user experience and testing accuracy.
  - **Solutions**:
    - Implement `waits` with `{ timeout: 10000 }` on `cy.get` and `cy.contains` to manage timed delays.
    - Handle asynchronous operations with proper promise resolutions.
  - **For Not Fully Available DOM**:
    - Use `{ force: true }` on click events to interact with elements that are not yet interactive.
    - Apply a "Double Tap" technique or an extra wait to ensure interactions are registered correctly.

### 4. Old Session Data

- **Issue Description**: Residual data from old sessions can interfere with new testing sessions, leading to false results.
- **Solution**:
  - Clean cookies between sessions to prevent data leakage.
  - Use `cy.session` to manage and isolate sessions effectively.
- **Example**: The **sso-020-sessions.cy.ts** file contains a `cy.session` block that can be used to manage sessions effectively and it also contains a `cy.clearCookies` block that can be used to clean cookies between sessions.

### 5. Memory Issues

- **Issue Description**: Memory leaks or excessive memory usage can cause test crashes and degraded performance.
- **Solution**:
  - Apply a Garbage Collection (GC) fix to manage memory more efficiently.
  - Break up workflows into smaller, more manageable pieces to reduce memory consumption.
- **Implemenation**: See **cypress.config.ts** and commands in **cypress/support/commands.ts** for examples of how to implement GC fixes and memory management techniques.

## Not-So-Common Issues

### 1. One-Time Passwords

- **Issue Description**: Accounts, such as those on GitHub, getting labeled as "Spam" when using one-time passwords (OTPs).
- **Solution**: Review account settings and configurations to prevent legitimate accounts from being flagged incorrectly. In GitHubs case, this may involve reaching out ro GitHub.

## Conclusion

This document outlines solutions to various common and uncommon issues encountered during development.
