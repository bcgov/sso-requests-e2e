- [ ] **Modified Features:** Have existing features been altered in a way that changes their workflow or output?
- [ ] **Deprecated Features:** Have any features or functionalities been removed from the application?

### 3. **Navigation Changes**

- [ ] **URL Changes:** Have there been updates to the URLs of any pages (e.g., changes in routing)?
- [ ] **Navigation Flow:** Is there a change in how users navigate through the application (e.g., new menu items, changes in page hierarchy)?

### 4. **Backend Changes**

- [ ] **API Modifications:** Are there changes to the APIs (endpoints, request/response structure) that the frontend interacts with?
- [ ] **Database Changes:** Have there been modifications to the database schema or the data that might affect the frontend?

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**

- [ ] **Loading Times:** Have there been changes that significantly alter the loading times of pages or resources?
- [ ] **Asynchronous Operations:** Are there updates to how asynchronous operations (e.g., AJAX calls) are handled?

### 6. **Security Updates**

- [ ] **Authentication/Authorization Changes:** Have there been updates to the login/logout flow, session management, or access controls?

### 9. **Code Refactoring**

- [ ] **Refactored Code:** Has there been significant refactoring of the codebase that could affect the selectors or logic used in tests?
- [ ] **Selector Changes:** Have the selectors (e.g., IDs, classes, attributes) used to target elements in tests been changed?

### Communication Tips

- **Detail Specific Changes:** When communicating changes, be specific about what has been altered, added, or removed.
- **Prioritize Impact:** Highlight changes that are likely to have a high impact on existing tests.
- **Collaborate Early:** Engage with test automation specialists early in the development cycle to discuss potential impacts.
- **Share Documentation:** Provide access to updated documentation, API schemas, and design mockups to help in adjusting tests accordingly.
